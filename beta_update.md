# 🎶 Songify — 1.8 Beta

Hey everyone!  
We’ve been hard at work adding new ways to request songs, improving reliability, and making Songify easier to use than ever. This update brings real-time Twitch event handling, full YouTube Music support, premium cloud backups, and much more.

## ✨ New Features
- **Real-Time Twitch Events**  
  Songify now connects directly to Twitch using WebSockets, so reward redemptions and events are detected instantly and more reliably.  
- **Song Requests with Bits**  
  Let your viewers request songs using Twitch Bits! You can set a minimum Bits amount to suit your channel.  
- **Cloud Backup & Restore (Premium)**  
  Save your Songify settings to the cloud and restore them at any time — with a preview of the differences before importing.  
  > This feature requires a **Ko-fi membership**.  
  > How to connect Ko-fi with Songify: [Read the guide here](https://v2.songify.rocks/faq/how-to-link-ko-fi-with-songify).  
- **Full YouTube Music Support**  
  You can now fully request songs from YouTube when using the [YouTube Music Desktop Client](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music).

## ⚡ Improvements
- **Better Refunds**  
  If a song can’t be added (explicit content, queue full, or blocked), Songify will automatically refund the request with a clear reason in Twitch.

  More reliable queue management and track detection when using YouTube Music.  
- **Cleaner Settings & Reward Screens**  
  The UI for rewards, Bits, and settings has been polished for a smoother experience.

  Added and updated translations, including Belarusian language support.
