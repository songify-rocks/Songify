This seems to be the first time you are running the software. I'd like to anonymously collect some data such as:

● UUID (randomly generate unique identifier, nothing personalized!)

● Current timestamp (to evaluate how frequent the software is used)

● If the software is running or not (this is transmitted on startup / shutdown of the software, no service running in the background!)

● Current software version

You can always opt out by declining this dialog or uncheck the box in the settings menu.
