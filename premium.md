# 💎 Songify Premium

Songify Premium unlocks additional features that enhance your streaming setup and help support ongoing development.

Premium is activated via **Ko-Fi membership** on the official Songify website.

Songify will always remain free to use.  
Premium expands functionality, it does not remove free features.

# ☁️ Cloud Sync

Sync your settings securely across multiple machines.

# 🔐 Secure Token System

Premium features use a secure token system.

### How it works

1. After Premium validation on the website, you generate a **secret Songify Token**
2. The token is shown **only once**
3. If lost, it must be rotated (a new token must be generated)
4. The token can be added to Songify in two ways:
   - Manually:  
     `Settings → System → Songify Token`
   - Automatically:  
     Click **"Import to Songify"** on the website (uses deep-link import)

The token acts as your secure authentication key for Premium features and Cloud Sync.

- Only encrypted values are compared
