# 💎 Songify Premium

Songify Premium adds optional features to enhance your streaming setup and to support ongoing development.

Songify will always remain free.  
Premium only adds features - it never removes or limits existing functionality.

Premium is activated by linking your Ko-Fi membership to your Songify account.

## 🔐 Secure token system

Premium features and Cloud Sync use a secure token-based authentication system.

### How it works

1. After your Premium access is validated on the website, you generate a **secret Songify token**
2. The token is shown **only once**
3. If the token is lost, it must be rotated (a new token has to be generated)
4. The token can be added to Songify in two ways:
   - Manually  
     `Settings -> System -> Songify Token`
   - Automatically  
     Click **Import to Songify** on the website (deep-link import)

The token is used to authenticate access to Premium features and Cloud Sync.

## 🔐 Privacy and validation

Premium validation is designed with privacy in mind.

- Songify receives Ko-Fi membership confirmations via secure webhooks
- All Ko-Fi tiers are supported
- Both the Ko-Fi email address and the email entered on the Songify website are stored encrypted using the same method
- Only encrypted values are compared
- No plaintext email addresses are stored in the system

Your email address is used only to validate your Premium access.
