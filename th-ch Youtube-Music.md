   Launch the YouTube Music Desktop Client.

3. **Enable the API Server Plugin**  
   - In the top menu, go to **Plugins** â†’ **API Server**.  
   - Make sure the API Server is **enabled** (toggle switch ON).

4. **Set API Server Settings**  
   - **Hostname:** `0.0.0.0` *(default)*  
   - **Port:** `26538` *(default)*  
   - **Authorization Strategy:** `No Authorization`

5. **Restart the Client**  
   Close and reopen the YouTube Music Desktop Client to ensure the settings are applied.

   With the API Server running, Songify will automatically connect and allow YouTube Music requests!
